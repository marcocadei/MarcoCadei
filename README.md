### Hi there 👋

I'm Marco, 30 years old guy from Brescia, Italy.  
I'm currently working as a software engineer Lead at [Bending Spoons](https://github.com/BendingSpoons).  
Here I'm busy creating, updating, tinkering and doing a bit of everything with [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) and [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) as **SWE lead**.

Previously I was a a Master's student in Computer Engineering.
